The theme of this post is

- robotics is "using software and optionally AI to make changes to something in the world"
- robotics is not **only* the physical world
- it's also automated processes
- especially if there's AI involved

This article needs a punch one sentence intro.  It can be provocative.

Then it should go into detail talking about "traditional" robotics, and then some emerging robotic applciations.  Make the case that "AI Assisted software development" (like Claude Code) is a form of robotics.  Then research other similar applications where software and increasingly AI are making real world changes.  Find and outline the three best cases.

Then talk about Nviida and "Physical Computing" and how the number of applications of robotics are increasing.  Refer to the product launches at CES 2026 for examples.

Finish with a conclusion that the era of software being something that had a mouse and keyboard attached is over.  Long live the robots!
