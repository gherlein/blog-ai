Write a blog post in my style.  put it in ./blog at the right place.  use greg-style-guide.md to get my style.

The theme is that over a period of only a few years I predict that software development will devolve into three levels:

- AI creator - those that are doing the extremly technical work to train and/or deploy AI models and agents
- AI-enabled developer - those that actively use AI tooling to rapidly build complex software **systems**
- Softare Technicians - those that can "vibe code" well enough to make applications and web sites

The first one will be extremely well compensated.  The next one will likely make as much as today, or maybe a little less.  The last will see a 50-75% pay reduction.  The skills/knowledege to do basic app development will not be able to justify higher pay than that.

Ultrathink and find references that support this argument.  List them and double check that they are real and that's what they say.
