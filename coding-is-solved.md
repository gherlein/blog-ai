Ben Congdon's recent post ["The Decline of the Software Drafter?"](https://benjamincongdon.me/blog/2025/12/08/The-Decline-of-the-Software-Drafter/) articulates something I've been thinking about for months now: we've crossed a threshold where AI tools can produce most production code.

He's right. The mechanical act of translating requirements into syntax is increasingly handled by AI. His analogy to technical drafters displaced by CAD is apt—those jobs didn't vanish overnight, but the skill mix shifted dramatically toward design judgment and away from manual execution.

## What Still Matters

Congdon identifies what remains valuable:

> - Knowing how code works at a gears-level is still largely valuable.
> - Foundational computer science knowledge is still largely valuable.
> - Software "taste" or discernment or heuristics is still largely valuable.

This tracks with my experience. Understanding *why* code behaves a certain way, recognizing architectural smells, knowing when a solution is elegant versus merely functional—these skills become more important when the typing is automated.

## What Doesn't

He's equally clear about what's changing:

> - Being solely a "coder" is a path to stable employment.
> - Being a software "craftsperson" ceases to be valuable or enjoyable. (Rather, I think the value will likely shift and look more like an actual craft – high end, not commoditized, but not mass market.)

The second point is the optimistic read. Software craftsmanship doesn't die; it becomes more like other crafts. There's still demand for bespoke furniture even though IKEA exists. The difference is scale and compensation expectations.

## The Shift

The industry hasn't adjusted yet. Hiring still emphasizes coding tests. Bootcamps still teach syntax. But the real work increasingly looks like:

- Understanding systems deeply enough to prompt effectively
- Reviewing AI-generated code with critical judgment
- Making architectural decisions AI can't reason about
- Debugging the weird stuff that doesn't fit patterns

Engineers who adapt to this will be fine. Those who define themselves purely by lines of code per day will struggle.

The tools won. Time to figure out what comes next.
