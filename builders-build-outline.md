# Outline: Builders Build

**Target file:** `builders-build.md`

---

## I. Opening Hook
- Two kinds of people in the world: builders and not-builders
- This isn't judgment—it's observation
- Amazon built an empire on this insight: "From very early on in Amazon's life, we knew we wanted to create a culture of builders—people who are curious, explorers."

## II. Building is Human
- This isn't just about engineers or software
- Builders exist everywhere:
  - Sewing and textiles
  - Jewelry making
  - Pottery and ceramics
  - Woodworking
  - Musical instruments
  - And yes, software
- Some people consume. Others create. **Builders can't help it.**
- Reference Amazon's definition: "builders innovating on behalf of customers, doing things that had never been done before" (Gallup/Amazon)

## III. The Problem: Software Got Hard
- Over the last 20 years, software development complexity exploded
- So much to learn, so many tools, all changing constantly
- Frameworks, languages, deployment, security, testing, infrastructure...
- Result: **builders like me HAD to have a team or collaborators to build anything non-trivial**
- Solo builders were relegated to toy projects or endless learning curves

## IV. The Shift: That Era is Over
- AI-boosted software development has fundamentally changed the game
- Not incremental improvement—a paradigm shift
- What Amazon calls "Bias for Action" is now actually achievable for solo builders
- The barrier between "idea" and "working software" has collapsed

## V. Personal Proof Points (This Week)
- Built a tool to read data from home solar system
- Built a tool to read data from home heat pump
- Converting a Python RTSP camera proxy to Go for Unifi Protect NVR integration
- Link: [gounifi-cam-proxy](https://github.com/emergingrobotics/gounifi-cam-proxy)
  - Caveat: Not tested beyond internal test layers yet
  - (Some framework code not ready to open source)

## VI. The New Bottleneck
- Writing software is no longer the constraint
- **Testing is the new bottleneck**
- (Tease: more on this in a future post)

## VII. "But I Don't Have Time"
- I get it. I really do.
- Raised two kids, devoted father
- Finding time to build wasn't always easy
- But AI tools have shifted what's possible:
  - A few weekend mornings
  - A couple of evening sessions
  - **Real, useful software—not toy demos**

## VIII. Call to Action
- Amazon's "Day One mentality"—every day is a new opportunity to build
- Bezos: "Good intentions don't work, but mechanisms do"
- AI is the new mechanism that unlocks solo builders
- **So what's stopping you?**
- Builders build. Period.
- **Let's go.**

## Tone Notes
- Conversational but direct
- No apologies for the "builders vs. not-builders" framing
- Authentic personal experience (kids, time constraints)
- Energetic close—this is a rallying cry
