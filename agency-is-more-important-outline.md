Conclusion:  the trait most valuable now is NOT knowledge (especially of merely how to code).  The most valuable thing is "Get Shit Done."  Garry Tan stated this best a year ago: "Intelligence is on tap now so agency is even more important"  https://x.com/garrytan/status/1894063324582625732

Andrej Karpathy explained this with a much better term https://x.com/karpathy/status/1894099637218545984

my own coding changes:

1. I'm coding again.  A lot. It's fast enough that I once again have time
2. it's so fun - you have no idea how fun it is
3. I AM MAKING THINGS AGAIN, EVEN AS A POINTY HEADED BOSS

My flow:
1. I write careful specs (with the help of AI) and then plans, and then tests
2. The last thing that's written is code
3. If I have a lot of tests that I think cover the behaviors, I may not even look at the code - I am not alone- see https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876
4. If it's broken I can fix it fast.

CAVEATS:
- existing code bases make this much harder, and may not work 
- code bases with lots of tech debt may be impossible to do this with (yet)
- the amount of human inspection needs to scale with the risks of failure

Concept to work into this: (TODO: verify source) - Scottish national soccer team coach said "some people think that football is more important than life, but they are wrong.  It's more important than that."

The importance of agency are MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT.

And the importance of AGENCY is going up by the minute.

This trend is happening, and fast
