I want a blog post about how amazing [Foreign Cinema](https://foreigncinema.com/) is.  I'll abbreviate it "FC" but you should spell it out.

Rename the image files in ./images to be <foreign-cinema-X.jpg> where X is a number.  Copy those to the ../blog/static/images/ folder and use them as section splits in the posting, scaled to 40%

Refer to my Google review below for my emotional take.

Have a catchy intro, but then in the post emphasize how good the food is, how fun and cool the venue is, and that they play classic movies on the wall in the outside walled in seating area.  It's fantastically romantic with a fun vibe and the diners are as diverse as San Francisco itself.  

Research and find the local charities that FC supports.  They quietly are incredibly generous.

Research and discuss the owner/chef's history in the Bay Area dining scene - they are practically royalty.

Close with just how good the food is.  Research and find a few famous quotes if you can.  

Also, modify ../blog/content/about.md where it discusses favorite restaurant - update that FC is my fav and reference this new post, but keep the other places listed.

## Google Review

Was shocked that a friend had not been to FC and he was shocked I'd not written a review. FC is my favorite restaurant in the world (and I travel to London, Paris, Mexico City...). The food is different enough to be interesting, similar enough to be comforting and just flat out incredible. Foreign Cinema should have a Michelin star but is probably too cool for that. The vibe is perfect San Francisco - but the "old school" SF that's been cool since the Gold Rush. I'm posting some photos of a recent meal but really, just try the fried chicken. Seriously. And if you have never been, head there for your next birthday/anniversary - or especially if you want to impress that special someone. Or hell, even on a random Tuesday if you just need cheering up. Pro Tip: they serve the menu in their bar Laszlo if you can't get a table!
