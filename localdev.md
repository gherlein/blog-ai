read this and revise it to be a complete blog post written like I would (greg-style-guide.md).  Be thorough and technical, but keep it fun

This blog post is about how I use Claude Code and let it do whatever it wants without asking permission.  However...

I keep it in a jail.  A container jail.  

Write a post about https://github.com/gherlein/localdev (also locally at /external/localdev)

Include using podman
Include it's a linux dev environment
With jira and Github tooling
With all my favorite dev tools

Then include that I make this bash alias:
# claude stuff
alias clauded="claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"

Then reference that I describe using this heavily in
https://blog.herlein.com/post/claude-code-gocat/
